ldesc: "The Hspell project is a free Hebrew linguistic project.
Its primary goal is to create a free Hebrew spell-checker.

The secondary goal is to make the algorithms and dictionaries, created
initially for the spell-checker, freely available. These could be used
in more sophisticated research or applications that require Hebrew word
lists or a Hebrew morphology engine."
